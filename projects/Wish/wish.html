            <hr>
            <p>This project mostly shows off my design skills. I was tasked with redesigning an e-commerce website according to what the target market requested. This project required me to use all of the design laws I was taught in the design. I am mostly proud of this project because it taught me to keep it simple. The project was completed in Figma as a prototype and due to legalities, I decided not to build it. The design files however can be requested by contacting me.</p>
