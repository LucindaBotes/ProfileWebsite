            <hr>
            <p>This project focussed on designing and building a prototype. We were tasked with going through the entire design process and building the app. Afterwards we had to do user testing and make changes to the app based on the feedback we received.
                <br><br>
                The app is a book tracking app that allows users to keep track of the books they have read, are reading, and want to read. The app also allows users to search for books and add them to their shelves from an online list of books. The app also allows users to add their own books to the app through either scanning or inputting the ISBN or by authoring their own material. The app then kept track of your position in the book and allowed you to add comments for the author to see. When reading a physical book, the app wuold go into a "focussed mode" where the screen would display an animation of a tree growing. The larger the tree grows the more you have read. Once the user stops reading the user can add the page number the user left off on and the app will calculate the progress the user has made.
                <br><br>
                The prototype was built using Figma and the app was built using Android Studio. The app was built using Dart with the Flutter framework. The app was built for Android devices and was tested on a Pixel 3a.
