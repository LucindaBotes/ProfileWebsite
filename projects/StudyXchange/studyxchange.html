            <p>For this project I was tasked with building a full stack website and host it. I was tasked with completing the entire software development lifecycle from researching the target market, writing up the design document, prototyping, user-testing, developing, testing, deployment and analysis.
                <br><br>
                The website is a student-notes exchange platform. Students can upload their notes and other students can read them.
                <br><br>
                The website was built using ReactJS with styled-components and the Material UI library for the front-end and NodeJS for the back-end. The database used was MongoDB. The website was hosted on Vercel using Github Actions to automatically deploy once the main branch was updated.
                <br><br>
                Overall I am very proud of this project because it was the first time I had to complete the entire software development lifecycle. I also had to learn a lot of new technologies in a short amount of time considering I had only 10 weeks for the whole of the project. I am also proud of the design document I wrote up. It was the first time I had to write up a design document and I am proud of how it turned out. The designs ended up really well done, if I say so myself, and the user-testing reflected positive results at the end with minimal issues arrising.
