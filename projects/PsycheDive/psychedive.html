            <h1>Psyche Dive</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>This was a project I had to do for university. My team and I decided to use Unity with C# to complete the game. 
                <br><br>
                The premise is simple. The player plays as a psychiatrist that needs to help patients that have been admitted to the mental institute she works for. The player dives into the patient's mental space to defeat their traumas. Each patient has their emotional traumas in the form of enemies but they also have greater traumas that have caused their admittance. The player needs to use their own emotions and balance it out with the emotional traumas to defeat the patient's lingering past.
                <br><br>
                The game is an isometric 2D game. The player can move around the map and interact with objects. The player can also use their emotions to gain boosts in order to defeat the enemies. It is a hack and slash game with a bit of puzzle solving.
                <br><br>
                I was in charge of the game's narrative, level design, audio and sound effects as well as general development such as the enemy AI, the balancing of the emotions and orb drops, the state management and all of the dialogue system. I also provided a lot of assistance to the rest of the team with any miscelanneous tasks.
                <br><br>
                A copy of the game can be requested by contacting me.
